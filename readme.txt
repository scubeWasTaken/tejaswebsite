Here are the steps you need to follow in order to use the Reiki front page template:

1. Access the Pages section in the WP Admin
2. Create a new page and name it
3. In the Page Attributes box on the right side of the screen, set the Template parameter to "Front Page Template"
4. Access the Settings -> Reading section in WP Admin
5. Select "A static page" for the "Front page displays" option
6. Select the page you have created earlier in the "Front page" dropdown menu

If you want another page to display the blog index you will need to create one more page and select it in the "Blog" dropdown menu
